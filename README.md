## Project setup

### Lightbox App (React)
- After checking out project, please follow below steps:

#### `npm install` [Make sure you have install node & npm manager in your machine: https://nodejs.org/en/download/]

- It will install all required dependencies (defined in package.json) required to run this application.

### Available Scripts: To launch your local react app
- In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
- Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Special Notes
- I have provided `assets` folder & `images.js` file for providing list of images with its all variants to render into lightbox component
